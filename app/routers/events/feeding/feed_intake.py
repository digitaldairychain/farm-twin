"""
Collects API calls related to animal feed intake events.

The duration and consumption of feed by animals may be periodically recorded
across a farm.

This collection of endpoints allows for the addition, deletion
and finding of those events.

Compliant with v1.4.1 ICAR Animal Data Exchange standards:
